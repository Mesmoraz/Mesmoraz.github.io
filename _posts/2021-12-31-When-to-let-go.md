I've given up already.

Just kidding, but really.

I'm writing this as I allow the project I started in early november, to be completed in late november build for one of the last times. I developed this game thinking I would port
it to mobile and it would be a great joyous best seller - where I could retire in the Maldives.

Somehow, I was wrong! Making a game, even though I had begun this work 10 years ago or so, so quickly I have forgotten how much work truly goes into these projects. I'm 
happy that I learned
- How to create a menu screen
- How to use interfaces to develop a hitbox system
- How to use enums to declare states and switch between them in O(1) time
- How to use a command game design pattern to optimize runtime calculations

And more...

the project I have built was for me at first, and then developed into a project I seeked collaboration on from aspriring students. Perhaps I spread myself too thin, or perhaps
no one would notice the pitfall of taking on too much because I gave these two students an opportunity to explore game dev. I'm not quite sure what worth it looks like here
but the chapter of "Hivemind" has come to a close. 

Happy new year!

Next year I will continue the growth I started this year in my game development journey.
