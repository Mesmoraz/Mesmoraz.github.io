## This is my first blog post...

There is so much to go over that I feel overwhelemd trying to do so in such short segments. Perhaps I should give an overview of what this could look like?

### First...
First, I'd like to show what I'm working on right now! I am volunteering with an organiation, DevLaunchers. We are a collective of industry experts and intrepid learners 
working on the robust task of developing a video game. A video game that uses NFTs and customizable code for all users - a community based game to provide folks
with some value. It's a really cool idea.

Second, I'm working on a personal project named "Hivemind" this is a name that my student gave me, thank you student! This is a mobile game that I started as a gamejam and 
now has become somewhat of a challenge to create due to the mechanics I want to implement. It's entirely solo, aside from the artwork, which I'm very proud of.

### Moving on...
I'm going to work on putting some project evidence up on the blog, to be continued...
